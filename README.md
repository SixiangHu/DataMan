This is an R package for data cleaning and preliminary data analysis.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning have 3 functions at the moment:
* `DetMiss` : This is the function to detecting missing value in a given data frame, data.table or vector.
* `PopMiss` : For missing values, we have choices between: deleting, and, populating with mean or mode.
* `quickTable` : Build contingency table from given vectors.

### Preliminary Data Analysis

Currently, there is only one function provided:
* `DataSummary`: Have a better format and more info compared with R core function `summary`.
* `CramersV`: Calculate the Cramers' V statistics for given data set. Useful for independent test.

### Model Assess

* `modelPlot`: Used to visualise `glm`, `glm.nb` and `gbm` model using by `ggplot2` and `googleVis` package.
* `sankeyPlot`: (Descoped) Used to visualise `rpart` model fitted by `rpart`.  This idea has already been implemented by `sankeyNetwork` in `networkD3` package, hence descoped from this package.

### Getting Started

You can install `DataMan` from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github('SixiangHu/DataMan')
```
