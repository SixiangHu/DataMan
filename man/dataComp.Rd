\usage{
dataComp(old,new,alpha=0.01,obs.lim=5)

varComp(old, new, alpha = 0.05, obs.lim)
}
\arguments{
\item{old}{data frame or vector. It holds the original data or data you are expecting.}

\item{new}{data frame or vector. It holds the data you want to test.}

\item{alpha}{significant level. By defaul, is 0.01.}

\item{obs.lim}{integer. To specify the a limit that factor levels with no more
than this integer will not be tested.}
}
\value{
This function will return a data.frame if inputs are data.frame.
`NULL`     - means there are no levels have more than obs.lim, hence Chi-square test is not conducted.
`NA`       - p-value is `NA`, because some levels have 0 observations.
`Nochange` - cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no change.
`Changed`  - reject the null hypothesis that there is no change.
}
\description{
This function judges whether a dataset has a profile changes.
}
\details{
A string vector will be return indicating factors that have a profile change 
if both old and new are data frame. If old and new are vector, then TRUE / FALSE will be returned.

Currently, this function will not test those levels with less than 5 obs.

A fisher exact test would be more suitable.

data(mtcars)
x <- mtcars
y <- rbind(mtcars,mtcars)
y$am[1:10] <- 1
dataComp(x,y)
